**WM**

I3 (gaps) is my Window Manager. I'm fond of this little gaps between windows. I
use [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) script to change the wallpaper
and the colorscheme of my softwares, like `gnome-terminal`, `i3` or `rofi`.

**Terminal**

I use ZSH with Agnoster prompt (with powerline patched font). I have customized
the prompt to show if the last commit is a Work in Progress or not.

**Lockscreen**

I use i3lock for the lockscreen. I have a custom script to enable multi-monitor
lockscreen. You can check [the script](./scripts/lock) in this repository.
