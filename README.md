I3 (gaps) is my Window Manager. I'm fond of this little gaps between windows.

**Terminal**

Alacritty is my main terminal, it is written in Rust and is very fast. As a
shell, I use FISH, that I find fast too and that has great default integrations.

**Lockscreen**

I use i3lock for the lockscreen. I have a custom script to enable multi-monitor
lockscreen. You can check [the script](./scripts/lock) in this repository.
