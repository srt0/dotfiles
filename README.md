**Terminal**

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is my main terminal, it is
written in Rust and is very fast. As a shell, I use
[fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), that I find fast too and that
has great default integrations. The prompt I use is
[starship](https://starship.rs/).

**Lockscreen**

I use [i3lock](https://github.com/i3/i3lock) for the lockscreen. I have a custom script to enable multi-monitor
lockscreen. You can check [the script](./scripts/lock) in this repository.
